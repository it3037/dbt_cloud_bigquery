# 📊 DBT Implementation Flowchart with BigQuery

This repository contains a **visual roadmap** for implementing **dbt (Data Build Tool)** with **Google BigQuery** — showing the complete journey from **raw data** to **analytics-ready datasets**.

---

## 🧠 What is dbt?
**dbt** (Data Build Tool) is a modern transformation tool that lets you:
- Write transformations in **SQL**
- Organize logic into **staging, intermediate, and mart models**
- Automatically document data lineage
- Apply **data quality tests** with ease

Think of dbt as the "T" in the ELT process:
**Extract → Load → Transform**.

## 🔄 Flow Breakdown

### **1. Source Data**
- Comes from transactional systems, APIs, CSVs, or other external sources.
- Loaded into **Google BigQuery's raw schema** using an EL or ETL tool.

### **2. Staging Layer**
- Raw data is cleaned and standardized.
- Column names are normalized, data types are enforced.
- Each source table gets its own `stg_` model.

### **3. Intermediate Layer**
- Business logic and calculated fields are added.
- Data is enriched and joined with other datasets.
- Prepares for aggregation or analytics.

### **4. Marts Layer**
- Aggregated datasets ready for dashboards and reporting.
- Optimized for BI tools like **Looker, Power BI, Tableau**.
- Tables are named with `fct_` (facts) and `dim_` (dimensions) prefixes.

### **5. Analytics & Reporting**
- Final datasets are connected to BI tools.
- Teams consume **clean, reliable, and documented data**.

## ⚡ Why BigQuery + dbt?
- **Serverless & Scalable**: BigQuery handles petabytes of data with no server management.
- **SQL-Native**: Write transformations directly in SQL with dbt.
- **Version Control Ready**: Use GitHub to track every change in transformations.
- **Automated Documentation**: dbt generates interactive lineage and schema docs.
